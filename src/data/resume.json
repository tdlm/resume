  "about": "Scott has been programming since the age of 10 and has over 15 years of professional experience in web application development. While his focus has been mainly on PHP-based development platforms (Drupal, WordPress, Magento), more recently he has focused on the benefits of using Node.js+React in conjunction with REST API to create a much-improved, isomorphic experience for the end user that scales well. Outside of work, his interests run from writing short fiction to creating/improving open source projects.",
